## Preface

This article describes how to use the components provided by Frosti in `mdx` to realize the functions that can't be realized by normal `md`.

## Main text

### Getting started

First you need to create an `mdx` file, which is as simple as changing the extension to `.mdx`.

### Introducing

The components provided by Frosti are placed in the `/mdx` folders. Write something under the document properties (frontmatter):

```astro
import Collapse from "../../components/mdx/Collapse.astro";
import Diff from "../../components/mdx/Diff.astro";
import Error from "../../components/mdx/Error.astro";
import Info from "../../components/mdx/Info.astro";
import Kbd from "../../components/mdx/Kbd.astro";
import Success from "../../components/mdx/Success.astro";
import Warning from "../../components/mdx/Warning.astro";
import TimeLine from "../../components/mdx/TimeLine.astro";
import LinkCard from "../../components/mdx/LinkCard.astro";
```

### Example

#### Collapse

<Collapse title="This is an example text.">
  This is the hidden content!
</Collapse>

```astro
<Collapse title="This is an example text.">

</Collapse>
```

<Diff r="/image/p10.png" l="/image/p22.png"></Diff>

```astro
<Diff r="/image/r.png" l="/image/l.png" />
```

```astro
<Error>Maybe something went wrong? </Error>
```

```
